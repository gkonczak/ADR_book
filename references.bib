Devtools encapsulates best practices that Hadley has learned from years of working with this programming language.Ideal for developers, data scientists, and programmers with various backgrounds, this book starts you with the basics and shows you how to improve your package writing over time. You'll learn to focus on what you want your package to do, rather than think about package structure.

It is designed for R programmers who want to deepen their understanding of the language, and programmers experienced in other languages who want to understand what makes R different and special. This book will teach you the foundations of R; three fundamental programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, and metaprogramming); and powerful techniques for debugging and optimisingyour code.By reading this book, you will learn: The difference between an object and its name, and why the distinction is important The important vector data structures, how they fit together, and how you can pull them apart using subsetting The fine details of functions and environments The condition system, which powers messages, warnings, and errors The powerful functional programming paradigm, which can replace many for loops The three most important {OO} systems: S3, S4, and R6 The tidy eval toolkit for metaprogramming, which allows you to manipulate code and control evaluation Effective debugging techniques that you can deploy, regardless of how your code is run How to find and remove performance bottlenecks The second edition is a comprehensive update: New foundational chapters: "Names and values," "Control flow," and "Conditions" comprehensive coverage of object oriented programming with chapters on S3, S4, R6, and how to choose between them Much deeper coverage of metaprogramming, including the new tidy evaluation framework use of new package like rlang (http://rlang.r-lib.org), which provides a clean interface to low-level operations, and purr (http://purrr.tidyverse.org/) for functional programming use of color in code chunks and figures."--Provided by publisher},

Understand data modeling and visualization to perform efficient statistical analysis with this guide. Get well versed with techniques such as regression, clustering, classification, support vector machines and much more to learn the fundamentals of modern statistics. Who This Book Is For If you want to have a brief understanding of the nature of data and perform advanced statistical analysis using both R and Python, then this book is what you need. No prior knowledge is required. Aspiring data scientist, R users trying to learn Python and vice versa What You Will Learn Learn the nature of data through software with preliminary concepts right away in R Read data from various sources and export the R output to other software Perform effective data visualization with the nature of variables and rich alternative options Do exploratory data analysis for useful first sight understanding building up to the right attitude towards effective inference Learn statistical inference through simulation combining the classical inference and modern computational power Delve deep into regression models such as linear and logistic for continuous and discrete regressands for forming the fundamentals of modern statistics Introduce yourself to {CART}? a machine learning tool which is very useful when the data has an intrinsic nonlinearity In Detail Statistical Analysis involves collecting and examining data to describe the nature of data that needs to be analyzed. It helps you explore the relation of data and build models to make better decisions. This book explores statistical concepts along with R and Python, which are well integrated from the word go. Almost every concept has an R code going with it which exemplifies the strength of R and applications. The R code and programs have been further strengthened with equivalent Python programs. Thus, you will first understand the data characteristics, descriptive statistics and the exploratory attitude, which will give you firm footing of data analysis. Statistical inference will complete the technical footing of statistical methods. Regression, linear, logistic modeling, and {CART}, builds the essential toolkit. This will help you complete complex problems in the real world. You will begin with a brief understanding of the nature of data and e ..},
